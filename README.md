# Gestion-des-appels
cet exemple d'application permet de recapituler les concepts de base de la programmation orient√© objet et de la conception logiciel

For those who do not yet master the Java object-oriented design and programming (Object, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Collections, Exceptions), see an example of an application typically made to summarize these concepts.
Problem Statement:
We want to design and develop an object-oriented application that manages contacts and phone calls made and received from a telephone. The device registers a set of contacts. Each contact is defined by their number, name and phone number. The device also records a set of calls. There are two types of calls made and received. Each call concerns a contact. A call is defined by its number, date, and duration. The cost of each call depends on its type. For calls made, the cost is calculated by multiplying the duration of the call by 2 while for a call received, the cost being zero.
This application must be able to perform the following operations:
Register a new contact
Record a new call knowing the phone number.
- Consult a contact knowing his phone number.
- Consult the contacts whose name begins with a keyword.
- View the total cost of calls.
- Consult the cost of calls between two dates
- Consult the cost of calls concerning a contact.
Work to do
1- Establish a class diagram that shows the manipulated data structures (entities) and the processes to be performed (Interfaces and implementation).
2- Write the java code of the entities
3- Write the java code of the IAppareil interface.
4- Create an implementation of this interface.
5- Create an application that allows you to test
